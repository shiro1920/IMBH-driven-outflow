## An Escaping Outflow in a  Galaxy with an Intermediate-mass Black Hole

### Abstract 

While in massive galaxies active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback plays an important role, the role of AGN feedback is still under debate in dwarf galaxies. With well spatially resolved data obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we identify a spatially extended ($\rm \sim 3\; kpc$) and fast ($\rm \sim 471\; km\;s^{-1}$) AGN-driven outflow in \textcolor{red}{a dwarf galaxy: SDSS J022849.51-090153.8 ($M_{*} \sim 10^{9.6}\;{\rm M_{\odot}}$) with an accreting massive black hole ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^5\;{\rm M_{\odot}}$, $L_{\rm AGN}/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.15)$.} Through the measurement of the rotation curve, we estimate the escape velocity of the halo and find that it is lower than the outflow velocity, indicating that the outflow is capable of escaping not only the galaxy disk but the halo. Compared to outflows of AGN in massive galaxies, the outflow size of our object is larger at the given AGN [\ion{O}{iii}] luminosity, while the sizes of photo-ionized narrow-line regions are comparable. These results suggest the important role of AGN feedback through outflows in dwarf galaxies.
